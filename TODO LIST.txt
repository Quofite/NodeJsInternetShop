THIS LIST CONTAINS EVERYTHING THAT I WANT TO ADD OR CHANGE

DEFENETLY IN NEAR TIME
	1) add comment in server file for review sender
	2) add plenty of comments in html and hbs files 'cause it's imposible to navigate in them
	3) make system that shows reviews separately for each car in site
	4) make system that shows reviews separately for each car in admin panel
	5) make normal documentation or readme

MAYBE LATER
	1) orders panel to android (like app for delivers or smth idk)
	2) posibility to answer on asks in admin panel and send them
	3) more cars (for what bruh)
	4) turn console order panel to loger (for what, easier to delete it, admin panel is quite lite for memory and cpu)
