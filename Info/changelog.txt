ver. 0.7:
- now reviews are shows up in page with cars
	- it's very row system atm, 'cause it shows reviews on all cars
	- in next patchs I will refactor showing system to make it looks nice and it'll show rate from one to ten
	- to make this I have to refuse using Handlebars, but maybe in future I'll return this (but it'll be after I'll handle with view engines)
	- also in next patchs I will correct html-block with reviews, because now it is a little bit crooked
	- server part is already commented (no way)

- corrected typo in page with dw-12
- Orders panel has been deleted (press F to pay respect)
- txts files (this too) were moved to separate folder

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ver. 0.6:
